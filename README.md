# dotfiles
stolen from https://github.com/holman/dotfiles

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gajewsky/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

cd ~/.dotfiles
```

```sh
(optional for fresh installed arch based distros)

sudo script/install-packages

scritpt/install-foreign-packages
```

```sh
script/install

script/bootstrap
```

This will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.
